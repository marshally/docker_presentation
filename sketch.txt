Bash + Containers = Docker

The easiest, most portable way to install Docker is to use Vagrant. Since Vagrant 1.5, Vagrant supports a Docker provisioning type just like Chef, Puppet, etc.

[Simple docker Vagrantfile goes here]

Who uses Vagrant, what do you use it for, etc.

What I like about this is the super simple install for new users who might not have homebrew installed. Or WINDOZE users.

So with this simple Vagrant file we can `vagrant up` ourselves a Docker box. This takes a lot of time to run, so I'm not going to demo that part. Just be sure to use this specific docker friendly vagrant box from our friends at Phusion Passenger.

[super simple Dockerfile]

Once we have a Vagrant box up and running, we need a minimal Dockerfile to get started with. This one contains only FROM and MAINTAINER tags, which should go at the top of each Dockerfile. The FROM tag tells the source image that we are starting with and the MAINTAINER tag conveniently points to me!

We can either execute this Dockerfile manually like so:
[code slide]

We can execute commands natively if we open a bash session with TTY flag

Or by updating the Vagrant file like this:

Now, we can install some editors and helpful tools

Install a web server

Install database clients

Install ruby dependencies

Install rails dependencies

And install RVM

Boot rails

Run the rails server

Hey look, there are a couple of Docker commands we haven't seen here yet. First there is the ADD command, which copies files from the Host into the container. Next there's a new EXPOSE command which allows a local port inside the container to be made available outside the container. Finally, we haven't seen this CMD before. The same way that FROM has to be the first command in your Dockerfile, CMD should be the last. CMD is the command that Docker leaves running while the container stays open. In this case, we're using `bin/rails server`

Caveat Emptor

HUGE WARNING: This Dockerfile is provided only for reference. IRL you would want to group these up because of the 42 AUFS layer limit.

Tricky Bits

How does RVM work? What does `bash -l -c` mean? Ask the audience.

Rerunning `bundle install` if the Gemfile has changed.

Making an entry point script

We are going to use a couple of new constructs here

Introduction to Docker
  containers

Install Docker

Install Docker using Vagrant
  choosing a vagrant box

docker build - < filename
cat Dockerfile.genericwebapp | docker build -t genericwebapp -

My 1st Dockerfile
  FROM
    FROM must be the first non-comment instruction in the Dockerfile.
Building blocks

  RUN
  CMD
  ENTRYPOINT
  WORKDIR
  ADD
  EXPOSE

Debugging a Docker setup
  docker run bash -l
  docker ps
  docker -t

setup Ruby
  rvm, rbenv, from source
